1. Break is used in the loop, this is bad programming, as it forces an exit of the loop. 
This can also prevent the programming from find additional index places that contain the desired. 

2. Continue is used in the if-else structure, this is bad programming and redundant as the code
will flow on and do the next iteration, and continue simply tells the machine to do that.

3. Use of index variable outside of the for loop, which is bad programming.

4. The loop will try to find an index location outside of the array, this is bad programming and
will cause the program to have a runtime error.

6. The program will still output a value even if it doesn't find a value.

Sub Module questionOne
I: array, value
E: None
Assertion:Finds index locations of desired value
Algorithm:
   index = 0
   WHILE NOT(array.length == (index - 1))
      IF array[index] equals value
         OUTPUT("Found value at index "+index)
      index = index + 1
